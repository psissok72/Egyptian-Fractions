File "egypt_up_to_5_NoIndexRepeat.hs.txt" contains Haskell code that output all sequences [d_1,...,d_r] such that: (1) 1<r<6; (2) 1=1/d_1+...+1/d_r; (3) No repeated index.


File "egypt_up_to_6_indices.hs.txt" contains Haskell code that output all sequences [d_1,...,d_r] such that: (1) 1<r<7; (2) 1=1/d_1+...+1/d_r; (3) No repeated index, (4) gcd(d_i,d_j)>1 for all 0<i<j<r+1.


File "egypt_r_is_7_indices.hs.txt" contains Haskell code that output all sequences [d_1,...,d_r] such that: (1) r=7; (2) 1=1/d_1+...+1/d_r; (3) No repeated index, (4) gcd(d_i,d_j)>1 for all 0<i<j<r+1.


TransversalCosetPartitionsOfGroups_Appendix contains the outputs of "egypt_up_to_6_indices.hs.txt" and "egypt_r_is_7_indices.hs.txt". The output "egypt_up_to_5_NoIndexRepeat.hs.txt" is in the Appendix of the actual paper (submitted for publication).
